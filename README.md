# animator
small and easy to use ui animation library for roblox
<br>
used in my game: https://www.roblox.com/games/18861634772/Hyper-Karts
<br> <br>
optimizations and contributions are welcome
<br>
restructuring is not (unless really good 😂)

<hr>

implementation example (for the above):
this is a combination of three effects, one for the hover(mouseenter) and two for the click(activated)
<br>
<br>
first require animator module

<br>
<br>
assuming these effects are children of animator, we can do this:
